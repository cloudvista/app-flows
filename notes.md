Digital help office there's a priority is referral management. One of the kind of priority areas?

And it certainly is for VA and we're we know we're around 45 billion a year in community care expenditures and then of course, we have a lot of expenses related to ambulatory referrals inside the VA as well.

We've, you know, Michael's Athena is reproduced some of the work.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 0 minutes 33 seconds
I don't know if it's yummy's work or others.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 0 minutes 36 seconds
Where, you know we're looking about it 40% cancel rate for cancellation rate, for referrals to get entered, but the cancel rate's much higher because referrals get cancelled even before you enter them.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 0 minutes 50 seconds
And so that's probably like an 80% cancellation rate and?
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 0 minutes 56 seconds
And I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 0 minutes 58 seconds
There's probably a lot of Vadnais in it, but if you think about, you know the the return on investment for community care referrals, if we can just make a 1% improvement.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 1 minute 9 seconds
That's like $500 million. And so so it's a it's a super.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 1 minute 17 seconds
Logical place to start and so and So what? The way we're approaching referrals is.
Matheny, Michael E 19 minutes 20 seconds
I think that's fair, yeah.

And so there is probably some, you know, good work that happened because of independence, but also, you know, maybe some waste of time, especially because of data preparation in a very intensive process. One of the most important things we've done is kind of standardize how we you know.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 19 minutes 42 seconds
We handle features in the in the analysis.

This would be and. So what we should be doing, Remi is like we kind of talked about earlier is as we're building out HT app or whatever analytical environment we're gonna use, we should, you know, really be having a more disciplined approach to code libraries and kind of.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 20 minutes 3 seconds
Treat them as open source resources along with you know, open source committal processes.

Yeah. I I just wanna build on some of the comments just from a you know having tried to do some of some of this work on in the field myself.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 20 minutes 20 seconds
I I there's there's two comments in the chat that I think are really.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 20 minutes 25 seconds
From my perspective, pretty important one one, I think.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 20 minutes 27 seconds
Sepa. You mentioned that you're hearing that work like this is already being done.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 20 minutes 32 seconds
I I think probably every single facility Envision is trying to figure this out and and what I would I think if you were to go to there might be a portion of facilities that have access to resources that are that that many of the other facilities on the.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 20 minutes 48 seconds
Enterprise level do not.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 20 minutes 50 seconds
And so the the fruit of of what we're trying to target to actually help on a scale when we're talking about a national enterprise scale is is actually in my opinion pretty low. Most people are doing like wouldn't surprise me if we're Middle Ages with stone and led.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 21 minutes 7 seconds
So and the main reason is because you know and the main reason is everything we're talking about here, which is.

The the the front end work of, of curating and and making sure that that data is.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 21 minutes 21 seconds
Is accurate, rigorous, and and that it's reliable so.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 21 minutes 27 seconds
If they're to that point, I I think if if we can really commit and if if we have the resources that people are interested in doing this, I do think that there's some low hanging fruit to be able to help the field that would get a lot of.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 21 minutes 41 seconds
Buy in because there's some guarantee.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 21 minutes 43 seconds
This is something everybody's doing.
Govindan, Sushant (KCVA) (he/him/his) 21 minutes 45 seconds

Carey, Evan P. (he/him/his) 23 minutes 10 seconds
Yeah. So excited to see everybody and and love to hear all these thoughts. I I agree with the standardization of the sort of technical resources and the software and code. I've been a part of some communities of practice like this in the past. And I think when we.
Carey, Evan P. (he/him/his) 23 minutes 23 seconds
Done that sort of thing. If it comes from a place of still somewhat disjoint projects, but contributing to a common code repository, it's of some utility and I think we what we we probably want to be even stronger here.
Carey, Evan P. (he/him/his) 23 minutes 35 seconds
In terms of somebody really quarterbacking not just standardization of code and resources, but.
Carey, Evan P. (he/him/his) 23 minutes 41 seconds
You know, sprinting towards good problem definitions in specific context that is also standardized and everybody agrees with and then saying OK.
Carey, Evan P. (he/him/his) 23 minutes 48 seconds
So who is doing what where which I think is a step beyond like a once in a I mean I don't know if that's coming on too strong, but if you want to make progress on this in the next 12 months, that's what I would do tomorrow.

Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 23 minutes 59 seconds
Yeah. So I think, yeah, so I I love that. And So what we're doing is using, you know, agile lean business case to define the problem and also the scope of you know what the solution is. And so.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 24 minutes 13 seconds
So.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 24 minutes 16 seconds
Our people agreed to, like, follow up on this in a week or two.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 24 minutes 18 seconds
Get back together and we'll put together an agenda in the meantime.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 24 minutes 23 seconds
About what to focus on.
Nebeker, Jonathan R. (he/him/his) 24 minutes 24 seconds
